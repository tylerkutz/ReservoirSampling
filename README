ReservoirSampling is a C++ class designed to perform reservoir sampling on an input stream (i.e., from a generator).  This code is not standalone/compilable, but rather is intended to be implemented in a larger generator program.

For now, ReservoirSampling also handles the ROOT output.  This is not critical to the sampling (output is not performed until sampling is done) and could be modified.

1. To initialize ReservoirSampling, you need to provide the size of the reservoir K and the output ROOT filename:

	ReservoirSampling* fReservoir = new ReservoirSampling(int K, TString filename);

2. To sample an event, pass the event weight and corresponding physics quantities (e.g., particle vectors) to the reservoir:

	fReservoir->SampleEvent(double weight, TVector3 electron, TVector3 neutron);

3. For a reservoir of size K, it is recommended to sample at least 10000*K generated events. 

4. Fill tree with events in reservoir and output to ROOT file:

	fReservoir->FillTree();
	fReservoir->WriteTree();
